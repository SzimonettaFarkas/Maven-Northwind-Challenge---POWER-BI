# Maven-Northwind-Challenge---POWER-BI

For the Maven Northwind Challenge, I'll be working as a BI Developer for Northwind Traders, a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet food products to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world.

As part of my role, I've been tasked with building a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive team. Its purpose should be to allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas, including:

Sales trends
Product performance
Key customers
Shipping costs
